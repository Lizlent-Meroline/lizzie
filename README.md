# Machine learning models

This repository contains the code and documentation for various types of machine learning models.

## Project Description
This project includes different types of machine learning models using datasets from kaggle.com. 

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project uses dataset from Kaggle.

## Files

* `data/`: Contains the raw and processed data files.
    * `raw_data.csv`: The original dataset.
    * `processed_data.csv`: The cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
* `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
    * `data_exploration.ipynb`: Notebook for exploring and visualizing the dataset.
    * `model_training.ipynb`: Notebook for training and evaluating the machine learning model.
* `src/`: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
    * `data_preprocessing.py`: Script for cleaning and preprocessing the data.
    * `model.py`: Script for training and saving the machine learning model.
    * `predict.py`: Script for making predictions on new data.
* `models/`: Contains the saved machine learning model.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.
* `README.md`: This file.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Lizlent_Meroline/Machine_learning models.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/Lizlent_Meroline/Machine_learning_models.git)
    cd customer-churn-prediction
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Data Preprocessing:**

    ```bash
    python src/data_preprocessing.py
    ```

2.  **Model Training:**

    ```bash
    python src/model.py
    ```

3.  **Making Predictions:**

    ```bash
    python src/predict.py path/to/new_data.csv
    ```

    Replace `path/to/new_data.csv` with the path to your new data file.

4. **Jupyter Notebooks:**
    * Alternatively, you can run the jupyter notebooks found in the notebooks folder.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated using the following metrics:

* Accuracy: 85%
* Precision: 80%
* Recall: 75%
* F1-score: 77%

The best performing model was a Random Forest Classifier.
